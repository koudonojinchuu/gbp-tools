# Output :  - if a debian/ folder already exists, error is raised.
#           - else, at the root of the git repo a debian/ directory is created, with the branch master, and original git is copied on branch upstream.

### Guess version number (from tags)
## if there is a current tag and it is unique, take it as a version
## else, maybe take the previous one, if unique
#by default:
version=0.1
##version=TODO

# Rename current branch to "upstream"
git branch -m upstream

# Duplicate it to master (the debianized branch)
git checkout -b master

# Go to git repo root
old_wd=`pwd`
cd $root_repo_path

# Create the debian/ directory
dh_make -p eudev_$version --createorig
## change the -1 in -0 in the changelog, so that when we start working the first releasable version will be -1
git add debian
git commit -m "debianize"
git tag debian/$version
