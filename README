gbp-debianize-gitrepo  will be implemented.
gbp-gitify-debianrepo  is only gpb-import-dsc, so we don't implement it.
gbp-debianize-and-gitify  is gbp-import-orig with additional code to create debian/ contents (first stubs).
      -> we may implement this one

Hub to all that, to implement :
gbp-debgit
  -> after that we have a debianized gitified repo, whatever we had before (in input).
Can take: 1) a .dsc
          2) a .tar.gz (or other archive)
          3) a git repo
            3a) with debian/ inside
            3b) without


Once we have the debgit repo, all to do is to create the Github repo, and then from inside of the local debgit repo on the laptop do :
git remote add origin https://github.com/koudonojinchuu/magnus.git               ## if magnus is the repo name
git push --all -u origin
So these 2 last commands will remain something to do by hand. Won't implement that in the automated tools.
